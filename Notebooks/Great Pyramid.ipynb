It is expected that smooth casing stones were added at the same time each layer of rough blocks were added, which is very likely. This simple approach does not require large ramps, elaborate machines, deep knowledge, or alien intervention. It just requires many crews of men pulling on ropes attached to rough stones. Of course, a number of additional crews are needed to place stones and align stones properly, but the solutions to those problems are well documented.\n",

    "# Ramps and Stone Size\n",

    "This theory might explain why there is little evidence of external or internal ramps, simply because a smooth pyramid can act as the ramp itself. It might also explain how large granite blocks were hauled up to the kings chamber. Considering the required rate of block raising, a wide ramp is needed. Narrow ramps that can only support one or two blocks side by side seem like a bottleneck. Ramps with right angles require more time to rotate and orient blocks. Using the sides of the pyramid offers the largest ramp possible on all four sides, so the only limitation would be the number of workers that could be on top at any one time. Even if one set of crews becomes fatigued raising stones, they could be relieved by another crew later in the day. It is possible that two or more shifts of lifting crews were used to minimize fatigue or injury.\n",

    "The Egyptians were free to decide how big to make the rough limestone blocks. They could have made them small enough for one person to carry, but they chose not to. After many pyramid construction attempts, they decided that 2.5 ton blocks were small enough to handle without too much difficulty, so raising these stones had to be straightforward. It seems that simply dragging block up the side of a smooth pyramid is a straightforward solution that they could have easily developed on their own. It probably seemed so obvious to them that it made no sense to document it."

    "In the modern day, we expect a return on our investment in a reasonable time, perhaps five or ten years for large public works projects. For the pharoahs, 20 years was a completely acceptable delivery schedule for their investment and exit strategy. To acheive higher rates of return, we built powerful machines, efficient supply chains, measured and optimized all of our processes. We just won't accept slow progress over a long period of time because our expectations and labor costs are so high. The pharoahs on the other hand, were in the opposite position. They had a large enough workforce that was willing dedicate themselves to a single cause over a significant part of their lifetime and this cause was used to great effect."
