## Anaconda Python

* Install Anaconda version 3.x

As of February 2019, Tensorflow does not support Python 3.7, so Anaconda must be downgraded to 3.6.

On Windows, it is necessary to run Anaconda Prompt as Administrator for the following step only:

```
conda install python=3.6
```

For the remaining steps, run Anaconda Prompt normally (Administrator is not required):

```
pip install --upgrade tensorflow
pip install Keras
```
